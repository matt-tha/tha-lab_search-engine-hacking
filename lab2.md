####Instructions

1. With the same target as before, search for `site:victim.com inurl:login`
2. If this doesn't return any results, perform a few variations:
  * `site:victim.com inurl:admin`
  * `site:victim.com intitle:login`
  * `site:victim.com intitle:admin`
3. Note what results are returned.
  * You may find nothing or you may find previously undocumented or unknown login features.
  * If you do not find anything, use your knowledge of the target's filesystem structure and conventions from Exercise 1 to refine these search queries and try to locate administrative pages or user login forms.

This concludes the lab exercise.
